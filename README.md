# SafeHouse

SafeHouse allows a customer to be able to control their home in a remote and innovative way. It is composed by a dashboard to visualize real time data from sensors (temperature, humidity and luminosity), complemented with alerts and the possibility to monitorize historical values. 
It also includes an interface, where the customer can add new devices, requiring a specific interface specified in the form of commands, allowing the clients to program the added devices to react to some conditions in real-time.
